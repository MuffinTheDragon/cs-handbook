      <p>
        This is a collection of various topics relevant to CS. Think of it as
        one giant handbook that explains all kinds of different topics that you
        can use to study, learn, get a refresher, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main goal of this handbook is to provide content of the highest
        qualityâ€”carefully curated and crafted to ensure clarity and accuracy. It
        aims to provide value that encourages readers to return time and again,
        knowing that they'll find up-to-date, relevant, and comprehensive
        information on all things CS.

      <p>
        Everything in here is open-source and fully accessible to anyone. That
        means anyone can also add or edit content in the handbook. If there's
        anything you want to add or edit, take a look at the contributing
        section to learn more.
